Create custom plugin file custom-mk-plugin to store code for registering Employee Custom Post Type and Location Taxonomy:
-
I registered a Custom Post Type called 'Employees' and a Taxonomy called 'Location' (for categorization). The code for this is stored in a separate .php file as a plugin (custom-mk-plugin.php) instead of in the functions.php.

On activation of plugin, the 'Employees' menu is displayed in WP-admin.
